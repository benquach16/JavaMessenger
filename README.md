# JavaMessenger

By Benjamin Quach and Tony Mazza

A basic java bulletin system written with Lanterna API for the interface and Postgres for the database storage.
Has an ncurses-like interface.


To compile, you MUST create the folder java/classes/JMessage since both classes are part of the package JMessage!!
You also must set up a postgres server and run the create_db.sh script.
